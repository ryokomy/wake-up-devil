WakeUpDevil is Ethereum smart contracts which help us to wake up early every morning.  
There are two main contracts (two main roles).  
1. Devil (TenDaysWakeUpDevil Contract)
2. RobinHood (RobinHood Contract)

You have to pay to Devil when you oversleep.  
RobinHood steals it from devil and send it to [UNICEF donation address](https://www.unicef.org.nz/donate-in-crypto).
